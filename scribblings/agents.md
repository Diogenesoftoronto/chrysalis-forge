# Agent Guidance: Scribblings

When adding new core features, update `chrysalis-forge.scrbl`.

- Use `@defproc` for functions.
- Use `@defstruct` for structures.
- Ensure all exported symbols are documented.

Note: Scribble uses a LaTeX-like syntax. Refer to the existing `.scrbl` file for examples.
